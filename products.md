## About these products

NestGenie products are carefully selected from proven, off-the-shelf equipment. Our focus is on the customer experience — helping you choose the right product, making setup straightforward, and ensuring you get to the enjoyable part (watching birds!) as quickly as possible.

We do not manufacture our own hardware. Product availability, exact pricing, and specific models will be confirmed at launch.

## Upgrade paths

As the NestNinja ecosystem matures, selected NestGenie-compatible setups may offer an optional upgrade path — unlocking live streaming, automatic motion alerts, cloud backup, and access to the NestNinja Hub camera-sharing community.

Clear compatibility guidance will be published when upgrade options are available. Some upgrade paths may require alternative hardware; we will always be upfront about that.
