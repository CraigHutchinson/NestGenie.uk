## What NestGenie is (and is not)

NestGenie is about thoughtfully selected, repackaged products for better user ease and enjoyment.

We are not launching custom firmware or brand-new hardware in this product line.

## Looking ahead

Over time, selected NestGenie-compatible setups may offer optional upgrades into NestNinja experiences, including access to Hub features where supported.

Some upgrade paths may need alternative hardware, and we will make that clear when announced.
