## A warm start, with room to grow

NestGenie is our friendly product-first branch focused on accessible bird-watching experiences.

As our wider ecosystem grows, some products may later support optional upgrade paths into NestNinja services and the Hub (in some cases this may require alternative hardware).

See our plans on the [Products](/products/) page.
