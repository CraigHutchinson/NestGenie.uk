NestGenie is the welcoming side of bird-watching — for people who want to enjoy the wonder of nest life without getting lost in technical details.

## What we do

We carefully select and package proven bird-watching products to make them easier to choose, easier to set up, and easier to love.

- Simple, clear product guidance from the outset
- Dependable equipment from trusted, established sources
- Friendly support for first-time bird watchers and families

## Who NestGenie is for

Families, schools, first-time bird watchers, and anyone who has ever thought "I'd love to see inside a bird box." NestGenie is the straightforward path from that idea to actually watching.

Whether you're a grandparent setting up a garden project, a teacher looking for a class activity, or someone who simply wants more nature in their day — NestGenie is for you.

## Our approach

We do not manufacture custom hardware or develop bespoke firmware. Instead, we focus on curation and the customer experience: selecting the right products, combining them thoughtfully, and wrapping them in guidance that makes the first steps feel easy.

That means you get a reliable, ready-to-use product without wading through technical comparisons or forum posts.

## Our wider family

NestGenie sits alongside [NestNinja]({{ site.ninja_url }}) — the advanced platform for enthusiasts, makers, and those who want live streaming, motion detection, and the full bird-watching community. When you're ready to explore more, we'll help you find the right path.

## Based in the UK

NestGenie is based in Eastbourne, East Sussex. We're a UK company, and all customer support is handled here at home.
