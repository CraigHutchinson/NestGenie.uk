Every year, millions of garden birds search for safe, warm spots to raise their young — and most of the time, we have no idea it's happening.

NestGenie exists to change that. We're building a range of simple, ready-to-use bird-watching products that make it easy for families, schools, and anyone curious about garden wildlife to get a glimpse into that hidden world.

## What we're about

Bird box cameras are not a new idea, but the experience of buying one often is: dozens of options with confusing specs, mismatched hardware, fiddly setup, and no clear guidance on where to begin.

NestGenie takes a different approach. We carefully select products that work well, package them with the guidance you need, and focus on getting you from "I'd love to try this" to actually watching nesting birds as quickly as possible.

## What's coming

Our initial range will include:

- **Bird boxes** in traditional and contemporary styles, chosen for common British garden species
- **Nest cameras** — simple indoor-view cameras with night vision and easy Wi-Fi setup
- **Complete kits** — bird box and camera bundled together, perfect for gifting or for anyone who wants everything taken care of

We're preparing our first products now. If you'd like to be among the first to hear when they're ready, get in touch at [hello@nestgenie.uk](mailto:hello@nestgenie.uk).

## Part of something bigger

NestGenie sits alongside [NestNinja]({{ site.ninja_url }}) — our advanced platform for enthusiasts who want live streaming, motion alerts, and the full camera-sharing community. When NestGenie customers are ready to explore more, we'll help them find the right path forward.

For now, we're focused on making the first step as welcoming as possible.
